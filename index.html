            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I'm Ani, and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at ServiceNow as a part of the IT Asset Management Team. I work with a highly motivated and driven team that seeks to produce features that provide immense value to customers through the ServiceNow platform. I am extremely passionate about the field of Sports Analytics, and spend a lot of my spare time playing around with different NBA and NFL player datasets and trying to find useful insights from this data and further my understanding of the games I've grown up watching. You can find all of my <a href="https://github.com/anikaranam/ML-Projects" target="_blank">projects</a> here. I also post some of my findings on <a href="https://medium.com/@anirudha.karanam" target="_blank">Medium</a></p>

                <p>I focused on the decision-making process behind fourth-down plays, specifically predicting the likelihood of conversion based on pre-snap data alone. By analyzing factors like field position, down, and distance, I built a model to aid in understanding the strategic choices coaches face on critical downs.</p>

                <p>In this piece, I compared projected versus actual salaries for NBA players, examining how well players' performance metrics align with their earnings. My goal was to highlight disparities between on-court production and contract values, offering insights into market inefficiencies in player compensation.</p>
